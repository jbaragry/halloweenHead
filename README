Screwing around with the RPi to create a HalloweenHead - 2013
Code started as a HalloweenHead class with methods that wrap the GPIO functions
It includes a separate console client to work the class methods.

Features:
   1. Manipulate 2 LED eyes: stare, rest, blink, crazyblink (opposite eyes)
   2. Play sounds: background sound, screams, laughs, etc


However, when adding a webclient I couldn't get a the webiopi package to work with the class code so I merged the client and class code into 

Files:
   1. halloweenHead.py: class with methods to flash leds on the gpio and play sounds on the pi
   2. headCmdclient.py: dumb console client to use the head class
   3. headWebclient.py: combine head and client code with webiopi to make it available through a rest intf with a simple html page.
